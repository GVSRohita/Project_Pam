Welcome to _My Neighborhood Map_ - by _G V Sri Rohita_
========================================================

## Basic Introduction:
**My neighborhood map** displays the map of prominent places in and around _Visakhapatnam city (my home city!), situated in the province of Andhra Pradesh, India_. Do not forget to, first, visit [my link] (https://gvsrohita.github.io/Project_Pam/) in virtual world, if you are interested in visiting this place in physical world. It is handy as well as helpful for you to know everything about it. Not for nothing did I use _Wikipedia links!_ In addition, there is some more fun part too, which you would know after reading further.

### A brief overview (including Technical and Programming details) about my project:
In my project, I have used `JavaScript`, `jQuery`, `KnockoutJS`, `Google Maps API` along with `Wikipedia API` (Third Party API) to display some of the famous places in and around Visakhapatnam city. I made this web-site fully responsive. It can run without any incovenience in Desktop, laptop, ipad and mobile phones.

### Website Running Instructions:
- Open [my link] (https://gvsrohita.github.io/Project_Pam/), preferably in **Google Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox**
- You will find a map of my home town _Visakhapatnam_ and the prominent places in and around it in the shape of _markers_
- You can filter the places based on the part of name-string of the locations in the _input box_ with the tag _Filter places based on the name of location_
- By clicking on any of the list items filtered or any of the many _markers_ that you see on the map, you can get information about that particular place, and also its **Streetview**, provided it is facilitated by Google
- You can also get extra information about the place, you clicked, by further clicking on the _Relavant Wikipedia links_ that get populated, provided they are available in wikipedia, in the box provided with the heading _Wikipedia Links for the Chosen Location_
- You can visit my Map on any handy device available near you, be it _Desktop/Laptop_, _iPad_ or _Mobile_
- The **fun part** in this app is described below in detail

### The Fun Part:
You can add your own locations (address, title and category of the location) to the map by following these steps:
- Enter the Address, Name and Category (Drop down Box) of your location in the three boxes visible at the bottom (If they are not visible on the screen, then either scroll down or click `The Fun part!Click here to add your locations` button)
- Then `Click` the button to see your location added on my map
- To start, enter **Taj Mahal, Agra, India** in _Address_, **Taj Mahal** in _Name_, **Heritage** in _Category_ and then **click** the _Button_ to add the geographical-marker for the symbol of the epitome of the most important emotion ever assembled by God, that is **Love!** . In addition, you can a lot about it through innumerable wikipedia on the **Taj**
- Isn't it fun?!

### What I did to achieve the objectives of this project:
- I used **html**, **javascript** and **css** to create this _web-site_
- I went for **m-v-vm** model for unobtrusive rendering of data from _model(objects)_ to _view (html)_ and _vice-versa_
- The **knockout.js** is really wonderful in helping me achieve this requirement
- The data-bind portion learnt from [Knockout Ddocumentation] (http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html), - [for example, links like these] (http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/foreach-binding.html) - came very handy for me over here
- The fundas about arrays and objects learnt while doing the previous projects [Online Resume] (https://gvsrohita.github.io/OnlineResume/) & [Classic Arcade Game Clone] (https://gvsrohita.github.io/Classic-Arcade-Game-Clone/) were put to good use over here to achieve the required objectives
- Learnings I made while doing the project [Portfolio Site] (https://gvsrohita.github.io/PortfolioSite/), especially in the area of making the site responsive, were put to good effect over here.

#### Sources that helped me build my map:
- [Google Maps API] (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/)
- [Knockout JS] (http://knockoutjs.com/)
- [Wikipedia API] (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)
- This list would be incomplete without the mention of [Stackoverflow] (http://stackoverflow.com/). Not even a single issue remained unresolved, whenever I went to it. Especially for coding for _pausing_, _error messaging_, its contribution is immense
- The inputs from my friends (almost all of them are anonymous - the pleasure as well as pain facilitated/inflicted by this virtual web world; pleasure because of their wonderful contribuion, pain for the reason of being not able to meet them in person) on _slack_ and _udacity forums_ too were very valuable in finishing this project

Thanks a lot for patiently reading this stuff! Now, it is time to visit my project [here] (https://gvsrohita.github.io/Project_Pam/)
