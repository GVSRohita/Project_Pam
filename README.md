## Basic Introduction:
My neighborhood map displays the prominent places in _Visakhapatnam city_. Do not forget to visit my link if you are visiting this place, it is handy as well as helps you a lot if you are planning to visit this beautiful place.

### A brief overview about my project:
In my project I have used `JavaScript`, `jQuery`, `KnockoutJS`, `Google Maps API` along with `Wikipedia API` to display some of the famous places in Visakhapatnam city.

### Steps to be followed to run my app:
- Download this file or clone it into your local repository
- Open `index.html` file with the help of **Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox** in your local machine
- You can find a map of my home town _Visakhapatnam_ and the prominent places in the shape of _markers_ here
- You can search for the places you would like to visit in the _input box_ placed beside the map
- By clicking one of the many _markers_ you can also see the information about that particular place and also **Streetview** of it
- You can also find extra information about the place you would like to visit in the _Relavant Wikipedia links_ provided
- You can visit my Map on any handy device available near you, be it _laptop, iPad_ or _Mobile_
